# urlchecker

This program scans the given website URL and the URLs within the website, returning the results as a list.

There are related files and scripts to run the project within a Docker container as well.

Before running it, you need to create a "config.py" file and put your API key in it.

In terms of frontend and visuals, this is literally as basic as it gets for now. I will try to work on that as soon as possible.
