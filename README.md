# urlchecker

this program scans the given website url and the urls within the website returns result as a list.

There is related files and scripts to run project within a docker container too.

before run it you need to create a "config.py" file and put your api key in it.



In terms of frontend and visuals this is literally as basic as it gets for now I will try to work on that as soon as possible.
